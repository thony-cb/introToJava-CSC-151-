// (Find the two highest scores) 
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the student with the highest score and the student with the second-highest score. Use the next()method in the Scanner class to read a name rather than using the nextLine()method. Assume that the number of students is at least 2.
